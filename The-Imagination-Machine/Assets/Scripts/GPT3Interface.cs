He looked at the backs of his hands, saw faint neon molecules crawling beneath the skin, ordered by the unknowable code. He raised his right hand and moved it experimentally.

Story:
Leaves scuttled through the front door to join a litter of glass from the shattered TV screen. Drops of smashed Jack o’ Lantern dripped from the wall, adding to the disorder. The creature the children had summoned watched the blaze on the hearth. The thing was tall, emaciated, with enormous, crimson eyes. It clicked its small pointed teeth together. Amid the fire rested the spirit board through which it had passed, now burnt and curled beyond recognition.

Story:
Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess.
She was so beautiful, in fact, that everyone who saw her fell in love with her.
Except for one man, who was well known across the kingdom for never having fallen in love with anyone.
The princess was so distressed by this that she decided to consult a witch.
The witch invited her into her hut, and the princess entered the cramped dwelling.

and looked at all the faces.
They were terrifying.
Each one was a fountain,
spewing blood everywhere.
They kept screaming,
and I was terrified.
